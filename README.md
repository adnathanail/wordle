# wordle-solver
## Python instructions
- Run `wordle.py`
- Enter the suggestions it gives you
- After each suggestion, submit the response from Wordle as a string of 5 `g`s, `y`s, and `b`s representing Green, Yellow, and Black
- Sometimes the words it suggests are a bit esoteric and Wordle may not recognise them, if this happens, just enter an `i` and it will give you a new word

## Javascript instructions
- The answer is actually validated in-browser, so you can extract it with a single line of JS pasted into the console
